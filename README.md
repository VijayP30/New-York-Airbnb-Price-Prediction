## Data Exploration - 
Our data exploration allowed us to explore multiple different correlations and points of information about our data. Our data contains about 456k observations, with 22 different columns and 20k rows. We then explored the distribution for each of the data's columns. Then we looked at the geographical distribution of our data, specifically what neighborhoods come up with most within the different NYC boroughs. Finally, created a pairplot to visually represent any underlying trends between the variables.

## Preprocessing - 
To preprocess our dataset, which contains information about NYC Airbnbs, we plan on examining the data for any missing values, duplicates, or outliers, and either scale them appropriately or discard those rows entirely (as they are incomplete). We will then encode categorical variables such as neighborhood and room type using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. Next, we will standardize numerical features using techniques like min-max scaling to ensure consistency for the model. Finally, if we have any text data, such as the title of the listing or the names of the landlord, we may not use those columns as they may have no correlation with the price of the listing, or we may use text tokenization to include those features in our model. We will split the data into training and testing so it can be effectively create our model.
